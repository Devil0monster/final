    <p class="h1 text-center my-5">Market Valuation of Land: Steps for Land Valuation in Karnataka</p>
    <img src="../image/pb-1.jpg" alt="" class="d-block px-5 w-100">
    <div class="container p-5 fs-5">
        <p class="mt-5">The market valuation of land is the estimated worth of a property according to the records kept
            by
            the respective state government. This value is the minimum amount at which a property sale can be registered
            with the state. The Department of Stamps and Registration in each state is responsible for maintaining these
            records and publishes the guidance values or market values of properties annually. The guidance value serves
            as
            a reference for the land's worth.</p>
        <p>These values can change yearly and differ from one locality to another, depending on various factors. They
            can
            even vary between different buildings within the same area.</p>
        <p class="h1">Factors Affecting the Market Valuation of Land</p>
        <p>The value of a piece of land can be influenced by several factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Age of the Property: </span>Newer properties usually have higher market values than older ones.</li>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Location of the Property: </span>Location is very important. A small piece of land in a fancy area is often worth more than a large piece of land in a less developed area.</li>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Quality of Construction: </span>Buildings made with highquality materials are generally more valuable than those made with average materials, even if they are the same age.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h1">What is the Guidance Value Bangalore?</p>
        <p>The guidance value, also known as the Kaveri guidance value, is the minimum price set by the government in Karnataka for property sales in a particular area. This means that you cannot sell a property for less than this set price, although there is no limit on how high the selling price can be.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">People often search for "guidance value Bangalore" online when they want to know this minimum price. The guidance value acts like a base price for properties. If the government changes this value, it can affect how much properties cost.</p>
        <p>The Stamps and Registration Department updates the guidance value from time to time to keep it close to the actual market prices of properties. This helps prevent illegal transactions and ensures that the government gets its fair share of revenue.</p>
        <p>Before you buy a property in Karnataka, itâ€™s important to know the land valuation in Karnataka and check the latest guidance value. This value will help you know the minimum price of the property and will also determine the stamp duty and registration fees you need to pay when you register the property at the sub-registrar office.</p>
        <p class="h1">Importance of Kaveri Guidance Value</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Property Tax Calculation: </span>The Kaveri guidance value helps determine property taxes because these taxes are based on the stamp duty, which relies on the guidance value.</li>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Stamp Duty and Registration Fees: </span>When you buy a property, the Kaveri guidance value is used to calculate the stamp duty and registration fees you need to pay.</li>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Fair Property Prices: </span>The Kaveri online guidance value ensures properties are not sold for less than they are worth, preventing undervaluation and ensuring fair pricing for property transactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h1">BBMP to Keep Current Method for Property Tax Calculation</p>
        <p>A recent draft notification issued on February 20, 2024, suggested that starting April 1, 2024, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) would charge property tax based on the guidance value in Bangalore.</p>
        <p class="fw-bolder">Proposed Tax Rates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Rented Residential Property:</span> 0.2% of the guidance value</li>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Self-Occupied Residential Property:</span> 0.1% of the guidance value</li>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Vacant Land:</span> 0.025% of the guidance value</li>
            <li> <span class="fw-bolder">Commercial Property:</span> 0.5% of the guidance value</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, on March 25, 2024, the Karnataka state government announced that property tax in Bangalore will continue to be calculated using the existing zonal method, and there will be no increase in property tax for the year 2024-25.</p>
        <p>Currently, property tax in most parts of Karnataka is based on the Kaveri guidance value, but in Bangalore, it is calculated using a zonal division method. This means that some areas pay more property tax than others, even if the properties are similar in size. The proposed change to using the guidance value aimed to make tax rates fairer across different areas and increase revenue for state development. However, the state government decided not to make this change.</p>
        <p>For now, BBMP will keep using its current method, which divides the city into five zones (A to E) for property tax calculations. Although BBMP had plans to switch to a guidance value-based method, this will not happen.</p>
        <p class="h1">Kaveri Guidance Value Goes Up</p>
        <p>Starting from October 1, 2023, Karnataka has decided to raise the guidance value by as much as 50%. This increase will affect property taxes because stamp duty, which is 5% of the guidance value, plays a role in determining property taxes, set at 2% of the stamp duty paid.</p>
        <p class="h1">How Much the Values Went Up</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bolder">For Agricultural Land:</span> It could go up by as much as 50%. </li>
            <li><span class="fw-bolder">For Sites:</span> It might increase by up to 30%.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bolder">For Apartments:</span> The increase could range from 5% to 20%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Karnataka government is taking advantage of the growing interest in real estate by increasing the guidance value. Also, they're encouraging people to register properties online through a new web tool called Kaveri 2.0, especially in Bengaluru.</p>
        <p class="h1">How to Calculate Guidance Value in Bangalore?</p>
        <p>The guidance value, showing how much a property is worth, is decided by the government by looking at surveys and market conditions.</p>
        <p class="h2"> Steps to Work it Out:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="fw-bolder">Go Online:</span> Visit the Kaveri website.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bolder">Search for Your Property:</span> You'll need to provide some basic info like where your property is, what you plan to use it for, and how big it is.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bolder">Enter More Details if Needed:</span> Depending on what you're looking for, you might need to add extra info like what kind of construction it is.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bolder">Check Advanced Options:</span> If you need more detailed info, you might have to give details about where your property is registered.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="h2">Example:</p>
        <p>Let's say you're thinking of buying a place for Rs 6,500 per square foot, but the government says similar places in that area should be valued at Rs 5,000 per square foot. You can then register your place for anything between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,500 per square foot.</p>
        <p>But if the property is being sold for Rs 5,000 per square foot and the government says it's actually worth Rs 6,500 per square foot, you still have to register it at the higher price because that's the minimum value allowed.</p>
