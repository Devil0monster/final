                    Synthetic Plastics Used
                    in Agriculture</p>
                <p>Plastic is everywhere, even on farms. Farmers use plastic to cover and protect crops and help them
                    retain water in the soil. Farmers also cover up bales of hay with plastic, so they look like giant
                    marshmallows. </p>
                <p>But what happens when these plastics are no longer needed? In some farming communities, permanent
                    landfills may be too far away from farms or even nonexistent, so farmers may opt to burn the plastic
                    they no longer need. </p>

                <p>In the 1990s, government driven extension services delivered research results to producers.
                    Researchers didn’t often meet the farmers their work would help and farmers didn’t have ready access
                    to researchers to be sure the findings were topical and practical.</p>
                <p>That disconnected system of communication is being replaced with more of a cycle, known as GRIP,
                    where each step feeds into another.</p>
